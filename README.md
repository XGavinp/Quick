# Quicksell-Frontend-assignment

## About Project
Develop a React-based Kanban-board app that interfaces with the provided API by Quicksell. Users gain the ability to group tickets dynamically by status, user, or priority, and sort them based on priority or title. Priority levels encompass Urgent, High, Medium, Low, and No priority, mapped to values 4, 3, 2, 1, and 0

Grouping options include:

By Status: Tickets are grouped by their current status.
By User: Tickets are arranged by the assigned user.
By Priority: Tickets are grouped by priority levels.
Sorting options include:

By Priority: Tickets are sorted in descending order based on priority.
By Title: Tickets are sorted in ascending order by their title.
A "display" button should allow the user to choose the desired grouping, and the board should update dynamically based on this input.
